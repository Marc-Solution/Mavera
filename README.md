# MaVera

### A short description of this website

[View the website in GitHub Pages ](https://marc-solution.github.io/Mavera/)

A website for the company Mavera. The company's intention is to give information about and to sell their organic 100% natural deodorants. ( This is not a real company or product. They don't exist yet. This website is made for a school assignment. )

### There are two types of customer we aim for:

1. The customer already knows why he or she wants to use natural deodorant and is looking for a good product. They already know about the danger of using ordinary deodorants that have chemical ingredients. This person has already decided to use organic deodorants.
2. Potential customer: This person is curious and wants to find information about the benefits of organic deodorants. This person is looking for reasons to use deodorants with only natural ingredients.

#### Wireframe mockups:

### Design choices

I wanted the design to be very simple and give a calming feeling of nature. Therefor I chose to have pictures of nature on every page. The simplicity design and nature theme reflects the company values.

### Images

The company's aim is to reach people who care about nature, therefor I used beautiful nature images to remind the user of the beauty of nature.

### All the images have a symbolic meaning

- The image on the home page is beautiful forest image with the products in it. The symbolism of this image is to show that these products are natural.
- The image on the products page is a tree with flowers. Flowers smell good, so the intention is to remind the user of fresh scents.
- On the shop page there in an image of a bamboo forest. According to Feng shui fast growing plants such as bamboo is a symbol for prosperity. 
- On the about page there is an image of a sunrise. According to some cultures a sunrise is a symbol for a new beginning and victory. This symbol reflects the company vision and mission to create a better world.
- On the contact page there is a pleasant looking image of water. The symbolism of this image is: Water connects us all. 

### Colors

Most of the page is in black, white and gray. I used colorful images to sparkle up the page. 

In the product modals I use colorful background images for each individual product that reminds of the ingredients in the product.

# Features



### Existing Features

#### On all pages:

- A responsive navbar with links to each respective page on the website. 
- The company logo in the navbar. Clicking the logo returns users to the home page.
- A Footer on all pages with social media links. The links open a new tab in the browser.

The navbar is on the top of the page and the footer in the bottom on all pages on the website.

### Home

A large image of the products on the home page, just under the navbar. The purpose is that the user instantly will know that they can find organic natural deodorants on this website.

Headline and text on home page that describes the products. The intention is to sell the product.

Headline and text on home page that describes the ingredients of the product. The intention with this text is to assure the customer or potential customer that the company only uses 100% natural organic ingredients. Also, the purpose is to brand the company as environmentally friendly.

After the texts comes two customer reviews. There is an image of the customer and what they say. ( The code for this section I took from the page whiskey drop that is a Code institute assignment. )


### Products 

Under the navbar there is an image that shows the products. Not the same image that's on the home page.

Efter this there's a headline that says Products. Then there are 3 bootstrap4 cards with 3 different products. Each card has an image of the product and some text. There is information about the ingredients of each product. At the moment the company only has 3 products. It has 3 different deodorants, so 3 bootstrap4 cards is enough.

Then comes a text section with information about which retailers sell the product and the price.

Efter this comes a thank you note to the customers.

### About

About text: 

Text about why this deodorant was created.

Mission and Vision: 

A text about the company values and vision for the future

Newsletter: 

A heading and text to get people to sign up for the company's newsletter. Under this text there is a button that opens a pop up with a newsletter signup form. ( The newsletter is without backend for the moment )

The purposes with the newsletter are:

- To give tips about environment friendly living
- To raise brand awareness
- Content marketing
- To communicate with the customer
- Competitions and lotteries where the customer can win products

### Contact

The contact page contains:

1. An image at the top just under the navbar
2. A contact form

The contact form has 4 input fields and a submit button. These are the input fields:

1. Name
2. Your email
3. Subject
4. Your message. A text field where you write your message.
5. A submit button.


### Features Left to Implement

- A blog. The purpose for the blog is content marketing and brand awareness
- A scrollable products gallery when the company has more products to offer.
- A FAQ page or section. This is relevant when the company has received more knowledge of what people want to know.
- The option to choose languages

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap4
- Bootsnipp liberty
- jQuery
- Fontawesome
- Google fonts

### New features added after testing

#### Added changes to the products cards

The original idea for the products cards did not look so good when testing it. The product information text on the cards became very stretched out on the mobile and smartphone versions.  I solved this by creating a popup modal with the product information text. Instead of having the product info text on the card there is a button that opens up a popup modal with the product information text.  Each product have a popup modal with the product information text, a buy button that takes the user to the fictional facebook web shop, and a background image with a nature theme. 

#### Features added after my second mentor session

After going through the website with my mentor, he suggested that I should add a link to a webshop. He said that if this was a real company web-site that they could easily start a facebook webshop and that I should add a link to a Facebook web shop on the website. So I did that. 

There are links to The fictional Facebook web shop on all pages and in the navbar.  Since this is a fictional Company ( at least at this point ) The links only go to Facebook.com, not to the companyâ€™s Facebook web shop since it does not exist. 

#### Features added after my third mentor session

    - The code for the modal I got from the bootstrap documentation. I changed the code a little bit. I use the modal in the products cards and for the newsletter.

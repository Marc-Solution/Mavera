### Existing Features

#### On all pages:

- A Footer on all pages with social media links. The links open a new tab in the browser.

The navbar is on the top of the page and the footer in the bottom on all pages on the website.

### Home

A large image of the products on the home page, just under the navbar. The purpose is that the user instantly will know that they can find organic natural deodorants on this website.

Headline and text on home page that describes the products. The intention is to sell the product.

Headline and text on home page that describes the ingredients of the product. The intention with this text is to assure the customer or potential customer that the company only uses 100% natural organic ingredients. Also, the purpose is to brand the company as environmentally friendly.

After the texts comes two customer reviews. There is an image of the customer and what they say. ( The code for this section I took from the page whiskey drop that is a Code institute assignment. )


### Products 

Under the navbar there is an image that shows the products. Not the same image that's on the home page.

Efter this there's a headline that says Products. Then there are 3 bootstrap4 cards with 3 different products. Each card has an image of the product and some text. There is information about the ingredients of each product. At the moment the company only has 3 products. It has 3 different deodorants, so 3 bootstrap4 cards is enough.

Then comes a text section with information about which retailers sell the product and the price.

Efter this comes a thank you note to the customers ( Inspired by Lily & hannas ice cream )
